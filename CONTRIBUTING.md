# Contributing to Skybison

This project is no longer under active development. We've made Skybison
publicly available in the hopes that people might find its history and
internals interesting, or maybe even useful. It has not been polished or
documented for anyone else's use.

We cannot commit to fixing external bug reports or reviewing pull requests.
That said, if you have experience in dynamic language runtimes and have ideas
to make Skybison faster; or if you work on CPython and want to use Skybison as
inspiration for improvements in CPython, feel free to leave a note in a GitHub
issue.
